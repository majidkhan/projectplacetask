LOCALSTORAGE API

## Summary:

- Create a working web application that calculates areas of shapes and displays statistics about them.
- No server side code, only HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
- Look and feel always matters, but code craftsmanship should be your primary focus for this assignment.

## Requirements:

1:  Show a list of shapes, for example, circle, square, rectangle and ellipse.
2:  For each shape the user should see three items of statistics. The number of times the area has been calculated, the medium area and the latest result.
3:  When the user initiates an area calculation of a shape, the dimensions of the shape needs to be fetched from a function that you do not control yourself.  It was required to use the getDistance function supplied for this task.
4:  That function will give you a “distance”. If you are calculating the area of a rectangle, you will have to use the getDistance function twice to get two values.
5:  Do not tamper with the getDistance function, simply source it in your application using a <script src=LINK_TO_JS_FILE></script>
6:  Once the needed dimensions are fetched, the area of the shape will be calculated, and the statistics will be updated.
7:  Statistics should be stored persistently in the web client. You can assume presence of the localstorage API.
8:  You are free to use any third party libraries that you feel would help you.
9:  Your code should be easy to read and understand.
10: You should be able to verbally explain your design considerations.
11: Presentation logic should be separate from other logic.
12: It should be easy to add new types of shapes in the future.
